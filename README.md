# Universal AI CLI Environment

**A governance layer for local AI agents to enforce engineering discipline, optimizing for hardware constraints and project hygiene.**

> "Stop treating AI like a chatbot. Treat it like a junior engineer."

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the configuration and scripts for the **Universal AI Environment**. It transforms a standard CLI AI agent workflow into a structured, audit-ready engineering process. By injecting strict "Global System Instructions" and hygiene scripts, it forces AI models to adhere to a **Read -> Plan -> Build -> Verify -> Record** loop.

## 🛠 Installation

**⚠️ WARNING: This script modifies your PowerShell Profile.**

1.  Clone this repository or download `install_global.ps1`.
2.  Open PowerShell as Administrator (recommended, though user-scope works for most parts).
3.  Run the installer:
    ```powershell
    .\install_global.ps1
    ```
4.  Restart your terminal.

## ✨ Features

*   **Global Brain (`GEMINI.md` / `CLAUDE.md`):** Injects a "Constitution" into the AI's context window, enforcing strict execution invariants.
*   **Hardware Protocol:** Optimized for consumer hardware (e.g., i7, 32GB RAM) by preventing full-drive scans and enforcing explicit file loading.
*   **Auto-Hygiene (`ai-auto-clean`):** A background daemon that monitors project dormancy and archives/deletes AI context (`.ai` folders) that haven't been touched in 30 days.
*   **Quality Gates (`verify.ps1`):** A local pre-commit hook that ensures worklogs are updated before a task is considered complete.

## ⚖️ Pros & Cons

### ✅ Pros
*   **Epistemic Integrity:** Eliminates "hallucinated on my machine" issues by forcing the AI to read context before acting.
*   **Disk Hygiene:** Automatically cleans up the massive amount of temporary context files and logs generated by AI tools, preventing disk bloat.
*   **Standardization:** Every project follows the same `WORKLOG.md` and architecture structure.
*   **Resource Efficiency:** explicitly prevents the AI from scanning `node_modules` or entire drives, saving CPU cycles.

### ❌ Cons
*   **Strictness:** The enforced "Read -> Plan" workflow can feel slow for very simple, one-off questions.
*   **Platform Lock:** Currently designed specifically for **Windows** (PowerShell Core / Windows PowerShell).
*   **Intrusive:** The installer modifies your global PowerShell profile to add aliases (`ai-init`, `ai-clean`).
*   **Data Deletion:** The hygiene script **DELETEs** files (specifically `.ai` directories) after 30 days of inactivity. While it creates an archive first, automated deletion always carries risk.

*   **Data Loss:** This tool includes scripts (`clean.ps1`) designed to **DELETE FILES** and directories. While it targets specific AI-generated folders (`.ai`) and attempts to create backups, the authors are not responsible for any accidental data loss.
*   **System Modification:** This tool modifies your shell configuration (`$PROFILE`). You should understand what the script does before running it.
*   **Use at Your Own Risk:** By using this software, you agree that you are solely responsible for any damage to your computer system or loss of data that results from the use of these scripts.
